### Difference Between BFS and Dijkstra’s Algorithms for Shortest Path

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - **Use Case**: BFS is used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, where all edges have the same weight (typically considered as 1).
   - **Algorithm**:
     - BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
     - It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.
     - The first time a node is reached, it is guaranteed to be via the shortest path.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**:
   - **Use Case**: Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph, where edges can have different weights.
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Dijkstra’s algorithm uses a priority queue (or a min-heap) to explore the nodes with the smallest known distance from the start node.
     - It updates the shortest path to each node as it explores the graph.
     - The algorithm continues until it has found the shortest path to all nodes or the target node.
   - **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) when using a priority queue.

### Key Differences:
- **Graph Type**:
  - **BFS**: Suitable for unweighted graphs.
  - **Dijkstra’s**: Suitable for weighted graphs with non-negative weights.
  
- **Data Structure**:
  - **BFS**: Uses a simple queue.
  - **Dijkstra’s**: Uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the least costly node.

- **Edge Weights**:
  - **BFS**: Assumes all edge weights are equal.
  - **Dijkstra’s**: Handles different edge weights and finds the minimum cost path.

- **Complexity**:
  - **BFS**: O(V + E)
  - **Dijkstra’s**: O((V + E) log V) with a priority queue.
